WARNING: THIS VERSION OF BOMBLAB WAS MADE BY WPI NOT CMU!!!
Good TUT for CMU VERSION:
http://zpalexander.com/binary-bomb-lab-phase-1/

NOTEABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO VERSIONS:
```
  The way the secret phase is accessed, and the secret phase itself (if you can figure how to do it be my guest)
  IDIV - phase 2 and phase 4 have a chance to have the IDIV function which makes doing those phases harder (I suggest getting a new bomb if you have IDIV)
  Phases 3,4,5,6 all have alternate versions that completely change the way how you go about the solution. 
```
Hints:
```
          Phase3: Generally has to do with Two's Comp (different contect in ALTs)
          Phase4: Similar to CMU version (but may have different equations)
          Phase5: Has to do with loops and counters (very similar to phase2) Has an ALT with using strings.
          Phase6: There is an array of numbers. You have to sort them by index. Such that the order they corespond to fits the requirements of the comparison statement.
        Phase7: To access it, has to do with phase4 (i think?)
